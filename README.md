c) Predict RFC (Request for change)

 The dataset contains a large number of IT incidents/tickets.
 
a)	Predicting High Priority Tickets: To predict priority tickets, so that they can take preventive measures or fix the problem before it surfaces using Decision tree model.

b)	Forecast the incident volume in different fields, quarterly and annual. So that they can be better prepared with resources and technology planning using ARIMA model.

c)	Predict RFC (Request for change) and possible failure of ITSM assets using Support Vector Machine model.
